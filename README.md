# AeroFusion-Multimodal-Deep-Learning-for-Urban-Air-Pollution-Forecasting
This project is about building a pollution prediction model that doesnâ€™t just rely on old methods like AQI history and weather data. Instead, it combines multiple data sources such as air quality measurements, weather info, traffic patterns, and satellite data to make predictions more accurate.
