# AeroFusion-Multimodal-Deep-Learning-for-Urban-Air-Pollution-Forecasting
This project is about building a pollution prediction model that doesnâ€™t just rely on old methods like AQI history and weather data. Instead, it combines multiple data sources such as air quality measurements, weather info, traffic patterns, and satellite data to make predictions more accurate.
It is a  project that explores how deep learning can improve urban air pollution prediction by combining multiple data sources such as air quality, weather, traffic, and satellite imagery.
Unlike traditional approaches that only use AQI history and meteorological data, AeroFusion uses multimodal AI (LSTM + CNN + Attention) to fuse structured and unstructured data for more accurate forecasts.

# Project Status

 Currently at: Data Preprocessing Stage
 Dataset downloaded from Kaggle (Delhi Air Quality Data).
 Preprocessing scripts written (cleaning, scaling, sequence generation).
 Next step: Model training (Hybrid LSTM + CNN).
